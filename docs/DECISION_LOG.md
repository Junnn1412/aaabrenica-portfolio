# Decision Log

Material project decisions: context, alternatives, reasons, consequences, and
the condition under which a decision should be revisited.

## 2026-08-15 — Page composition strategy: in-memory Vite plugin (transformIndexHtml)

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** PF-010 duplicated header/nav/footer markup across all 11 static
  HTML routes. PF-011 needed a package-free way to share that markup without
  adding an npm dependency or a Vite HTML plugin package.
- **Options considered:**
  1. Pre-build Node script generating real HTML files to disk before `vite build`.
  2. A Vite inline plugin (no package) using the `transformIndexHtml` hook to
     compose shared markup in memory, for both dev and build.
  3. Status quo — keep duplicating markup per file.
- **Decision:** Option 2 — an inline `transformIndexHtml`-based composer.
- **Reasons:** Uses only the already-installed `vite` package's own plugin
  API; nothing is ever written to the source tree, eliminating the entire
  generated-file staleness/lifecycle/cleanup risk category that option 1
  would introduce.
- **Trade-offs:** The 11 physical HTML skeleton files remain intentionally
  identical (~10 lines each) rather than fully eliminated, since removing
  even that would require generating files to disk. Vite does not
  auto-restart the dev server on changes to files statically imported by
  `vite.config.js` (a real, confirmed limitation — vitejs/vite#5780,
  #21655), so an explicit file watcher + `server.restart()` was added
  (`src/pages/dev-watcher.js`), trading a short full-restart per content
  edit for guaranteed freshness.
- **Consequences:** Content/template/partial edits during `npm run dev`
  cause a brief full server restart rather than instant HMR. Route,
  content, and template registration is validated by a dedicated script
  (`scripts/validate-routes.mjs`) run automatically before `dev` and
  `build`; the actual composed HTML output is separately verified by
  `scripts/verify-build-output.mjs`, run automatically after `build`.
- **Revisit condition:** If per-edit restart latency becomes a real
  friction point, or if a second profession's content needs genuinely
  diverge from this shape, reconsider Option 1 or a more granular
  cache-invalidation approach.
